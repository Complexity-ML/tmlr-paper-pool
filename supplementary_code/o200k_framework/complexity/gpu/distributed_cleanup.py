Distributed cleanup — prevents broken pipe loops on crash.

Usage:
    from complexity.gpu.distributed_cleanup import safe_main

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        safe_main(main)

This wraps main() with proper NCCL cleanup on ANY exit (crash, Ctrl+C, success).
Without this, crashed NCCL processes spam "broken pipe" forever.
