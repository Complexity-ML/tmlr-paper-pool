"""
RCCL configuration for AMD ROCm multi-GPU and multi-node training.

ROCm uses RCCL (ROCm Communication Collectives Library) as its NCCL-compatible
collective backend. PyTorch exposes it through the same `nccl` backend name,
but most tuning knobs live behind RCCL-prefixed env vars *or* the NCCL_* names
that RCCL also honors.

This module mirrors `nccl_config.py` but with AMD-specific defaults:
  - GDR (GPU Direct RDMA) levels via NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL
  - HSA_FORCE_FINE_GRAIN_PCIE for stable P2P across MI300X xGMI links
  - NCCL_IB_HCA / NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME for multi-node fabric selection
  - Longer timeouts (multi-node TCP/IB init can take >120s on cold start)

    Configure RCCL for AMD MI250/MI300 training.

    Args:
        multi_node: True when launching across >1 host. Enables IB plugin,
            forces fine-grain PCIe, and raises the heartbeat timeout.
        socket_ifname: NIC name for RCCL bootstrap (e.g. "ens6np0", "ibp0s0f0").
            On AMD cloud the right NIC is rarely eth0 — leaving this unset
            lets RCCL probe, but on multi-NIC nodes you almost always want to
            pin it explicitly.
        ib_hca: InfiniBand HCA(s) to use, e.g. "mlx5_0,mlx5_1". Only set if
            the node actually has IB/RoCE; otherwise leave None and RCCL will
            fall back to TCP via `socket_ifname`.
        gdr_level: GPU Direct RDMA level. "PHB" works on most MI300X nodes;
            "SYS" disables GDR (slowest, safest fallback).
        timeout_s: NCCL heartbeat timeout. 1800s (30min) is the safe default
            for multi-node — first all_reduce after dataset shard init can
            take minutes on cold caches.
        p2p: Enable xGMI/PCIe P2P between GPUs within a node.
        debug: Set NCCL_DEBUG=INFO to dump topology / fabric selection at init.

    All env vars are only set if not already present, so user overrides via
    `export NCCL_...` on the launch command stick.
